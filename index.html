    <h2> My Biography</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        My name is Agbo Chimezie Emmanuel and I am an Estate Surveyor and Valuer at Festus Egbulefu and Company. I am also aspiring to become an accomplished coder <br>and programmer, and hope to use my skills to contribute to the exciting technological advancements that happen every day around the world. I graduated from the Federal <br>University of Technology in 2018 with a bachelor's degree in Estate Management and Valuation.<br>
        As one who has transitioned into tech for over a year now, I still feel like I'm not job ready because of My learning tecniques. So for a better and practical knowledge, <br>I decided to join Altschool for a number of reasons. Some of which are their mode of teaching, mentorship programs, certification among others. I strongly believe AltSchool is the <br>right place to be, and my decision has been the best so far. <br>
